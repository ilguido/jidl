# the dummy datalogger prints all the read values to the standard output

# since it cannot read its configuration from a db, it reads the configuration 
# from a INI file: this is the file name
name=json
# the directory where the configuration INI file is located
dir=test/
# in this case the configuration is read from "test/json.ini"
